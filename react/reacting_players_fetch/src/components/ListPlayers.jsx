  Short instructions
  -----------------
  This component is used to display a list of  ayers. It receives getPlayer and players as props.

  For ids, classes and html elements, refer to tests in the __tests__ folder to pass the unit tests, and  the cypress/e2e folder for the end-to-end tests.

  BEWARE: some tests do not pass if you do not handle the case where the players prop is an empty array, or null.

  A proposed approach (again, feel free to go your own way)
  --------------------
  Step 1: Update Component Props
    Modify the component to accept two props:
      players: An array of player objects to be displayed.
      getPlayer: A function to handle clicks on individual players.

Step 2: Add a Fallback for Invalid Players Data 
  Inside the component:
    Check if players is null or not an array.
    If invalid, assign it an empty array to ensure the component renders without errors.

Step 3: Render a List Header
  Add an <h2> element at the top of the component to display a title.
Step 4: Render a List of Players
    Use a <ul> element with an id attribute set to "players-list".
    Iterate over the players array and for each player object:
        Render a <ListPlayer> component.
        Pass the following props to ListPlayer:
            key: Set it to the unique id of the player.
            player: Pass the current player object.
            onClick: Pass the getPlayer function.

import { ListPlayer } from './ListPlayer';

export const ListPlayers = ({ players, selectPlayer }) => {
  return (
    <ul id="players-list">
      {players.map(player => (
        <ListPlayer 
          key={player.id} 
          player={player} 
          onClick={selectPlayer}
        />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
