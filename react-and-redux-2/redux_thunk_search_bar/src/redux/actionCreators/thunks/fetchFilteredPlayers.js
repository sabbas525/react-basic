 * Student instructions:
 * 
 * To implement the fetchFilteredPlayers functionality correctly, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Create an exported function named fetchFilteredPlayers that accepts a searchTerm as its parameter. This function will be responsible for filtering players based on the provided search term
 * 
 * 2.  The function should return an asynchronous thunk function. This allows the function to perform asynchronous operations, such as filtering or making API calls, before dispatching an action.
 * 
 * 3. Use the getState parameter within the thunk function to access the current state of the Redux store. Specifically, retrieve the list of players from the state.
 * 
 * 4. Filter Players, implement logic to filter the players based on the searchTerm. This involves matching the search term against player names in a case-insensitive manner.
 * 
 * 5. Simulate an API Call - simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., an API call) using a delay.
 *  Something like
 *      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300));
 *  will do nicely here.
 * 
 * 6. Dispatch an Action - after obtaining the filtered list of players, 
 * dispatch an action to update the state. The action should include the filtered 
 * players as the payload and use the appropriate action type constant of SET_FILTERED_PLAYERS.
 *

    );
    // Simulate an async API call delay
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300));
